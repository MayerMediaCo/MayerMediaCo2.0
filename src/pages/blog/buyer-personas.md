# What are Buyer Personas

Buyer Personas are a relatively new concept, coming with the rise of content marketing, and SHOULD be an integral part of every modern marketing strategy, digital or not. The idea behind the buyer persona is pretty simple, using statistics from actual customers, or your ideal audience, you create fake personas in order to better direct your efforts to fit towards one of your ideal audiences. Depending on the scope of your marketing strategy and how niche your product is, you can many personas or very few, and you can always add and tweak as time goes on.

## Where to Start

First things first, you must know your audience, or personify your ideal audience. Start with the basics, demographics.

Focus on:

* career
* income
* size of family
* education
* religion
* age
* gender
* location
* marital status
* ethnicity

You can plug and play and come up with various different combinations to create your personas. Alternatively, you can pull demographics from your analytics pages or conduct interviews with current customers to gain a better understanding of them as a consumer, strengthening your knowledge of your consumers for the next part.

At this point, you want to add substance to your personas outside of just basic demographics. If you conduct interviews with actual customers, you can base these off of interviews. If you are just developing your marketing strategy, you have a little bit more flexibility in creating these personas. Ideally you will want at least a few that are vastly different, yet still in, your targeted audience.

Once you gather all of your information, it is time to put it all together!

## Personality and Stories of your Clients

You will then want to create a back story for your personas. This will usually entail relevant information that can impact or be affected by your niche or product. What are some of the goals and challenges these individuals have. Have they had any experiences that left a good or bad taste in their mouths? Ultimately, you will want to include any relevant information that can help you more specifically target this person as a consumer. When creating my buyer personas, I try to keep it short and simple. Just a few key demographics, key goals, challenges this person may face which would lead them to seek my services, and a small blurb of personality or back story. I also like to find a random picture through google of what this person may look like, to help put a face to the name.

I have seen people get incredibly creative with their layout for their buyer personas, and for presenting in a meeting or to anyone this will probably be the route you will like to take, but I prefer to keep mine simple on a Word document which i export to a PDF file and keep on all my devices for whenever I may need them. The choice of this is all a matter of preference and how you work.

It may also help to create negative buyer personas as well. You will need the same information, but instead of making these personas for your target audience, create them for the type of people you do not want to work with or that would not be a good fit for your product or services. Doing this can help you identify key factors in a customer that red flag you that may help save you a lot of time, effort, and headaches down the road.

## Putting it all Together

By creating these buyer personas you leverage key insights into your customers thoughts and actions, and provide yourself a more clear and defined path when focusing your marketing campaign on key audiences.

They can be as simple or as complex as you feel they need to be, but ultimately your marketing campaigns will only improve by establishing these personas early on when developing your strategy, and utilizing them accordingly throughout. Make these accessible, and make it a focus to always try to entertain at least one of these personas through content creation, product development or service structuring.
