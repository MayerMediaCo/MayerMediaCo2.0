# Overwhelmed by the process of planning a website?

Taking your brand or business online is one of the most exciting first steps to bringing your vision to life, but it is not without its challenges.  Creating a website is a huge undertaking that requires planning and a vision of how you want your website to function.  Things to consider include picking a hosting provider that fits your needs, what kind of message you are trying to portray to your target audience.

I am writing this to be a helpful guide to make sure you have everything thought of as you start planning your online space to maximize effectiveness and to help make the process as painless as possible. 

I will be breaking the process down into three different areas of thought. These include your brand, your sites functionality, and logistics.  So grab a pen and some paper and lets start working out the details for your new webpage!


## Your Brand

Your brand is what connects you with your audience and includes way more than just your logo and a font you really like.  Colors, tone of voice, imagery, and the overall style and feel of your website should all be reflective of your brand.

While your brand goes well beyond just your website, if you do not have an established brand identity, now is the time to start establishing one.  Before planning your brand,  there are a few key things to think of.

Who is you audience and what are they looking for?  What emotions are you trying to appeal to in your audience?  Are you targeting a very niche subset of individuals or are you going for a broader scope with who you target.  What does your brand mean to you and why does this matter to your audience?

After establishing the basis of your brand, you can start having a little more fun with bringing that vision to life. Whether you are working with a brand strategist or bouncing ideas off of a friend, you will need to start applying the decisions you have made for your brand into what will be on your website.

What colors are unique to your brand?  I always recommend my clients pick 2-3 colors at most.  What overall style does you want your brand and website to give off?  Are you ultra minimalistic and clean or more rugged and edgy?  Does your logo fit in with this style?  What kind of tone do you give off in your online writing, whether that is the more conversational tone used on social media or copy for your actual page.

Another consideration is your imagery.  Does it make more sense for your brand to utilize illustrations or photographs?  As far as these images goes, the possibilities can be incredibly overwhelming. You can use portraits and other clean photography styles, icons and line drawings, full animations, and so much more.

Finally, what story are you telling with your brand? Whether you aim to sell a product or service, or are just looking for like minded individuals, a story to your branding will tie everything together.

As you are going through these areas, you will notice that they tend to work off of themselves as well.  Your colors will affect your styling choices to an extent and those same styling choices will lend themselves better to some forms of imagery over others.  The best way to go about branding it to mix and match the different elements you like and see how they all play together.

While this is barely scratching the surface of branding, it is a good way to get you up and running with it. Once you have a solid plan for the branding of your site, you can start thinking about the features and functionality you want out of your site.

## Features and Functionality

Every website will have different needs based on your brand and your overall goals for your site. An E-Commerce site will have much different needs than a site hosting a forum or a personal blog or portfolio.

What is the goal of your site?

If you are selling a product or service, how will you take payments?  Are you selling a ton of products to where your site will benefit from a filtering or search feature? If you are selling an E-Book or other digital goods, will you be emailing the client your product yourself or will you want an automated system in place?  If you have physical goods to sell, will you need inventory management for your site?

Will your clients have a log in for the site?  If they do, what will they have access to after they log in?  And how will your users be authenticated in a safe and secure way?  How are you storing your customers information?

There are a ton of different pages and features that are possible for your site but how do you know what you need? A lot of this determination comes from a combination of your branding and marketing strategy. Looking at your brand story and your marketing funnel should point you to key features, some of which include:

*   Store Pickers
*   Shopping System
*   Blog
*   Content Management System
*   Google Map
*   Contact Forms
*   Social Feeds
*   Links to external sites
*   Database
*   Specific pages (about / contact / store / blog)
*   Image Sliders
*   Email Marketing Capture Forms

If you have already established how you want your sales funnel to operate, it can be helpful to deconstruct your funnel to see what features you will need.  

There are a tons of different features you may want or need for your website. You are not expected to know what your exact needs or wants are.  Having some ideas for your developer to go off of can kick start some brainstorming. Identifying these needs early removes the risk of changing course mid project.

Some features may be more appropriate than others, and some will just make sense as a way to meet your goals.  If you feel stuck, it helps to look at similar websites in your niche or that just plain inspire you.  Look at what features they use, pages they are implementing, and you can even reach out to them and ask questions.

## Logistics

The final area to consider when planning a website is the logistical aspects of it.  This includes things such as hosting, asset collections, and domains.   

Determining a host to use can be challenging.  Some of the features and specs may be foreign unless you are web savvy.  It can also be easy to get dragged into hosts that may not be suitable or are bad.

Hosting providers offer a ton of features that are usually on different paid tiers.  Some of these features include:

*   C-Panel administration (Admin panel for your website)
*   Custom Email for your domain name
*   Free domain with hosting package
*   Database hosting
*   Tech Support
*   Free SSL Certificates (basic security feature of websites)
*   Free credits for services such as Adwords
*   Disk Storage
*   Statistics and more

During this phase, I  recommend working with your developer to make the right choice. There are tons of factors based on individual needs.  One such is the use of static or dynamic data on the site.

Dynamic data would be something like Facebook or Reddit.  Everyone logging in has a different content and different experiences.  This would need a server and back end to function.  Static sites are the same for everyone for the most part.  There is a level of customization in experience on static sites.  It is far less than  dynamic sites, but may be suitable for more users needs; unless you are making the next Facebook 

There are benefits to having a server.  Servers provide private real estate for your databases and business needs.  You can query dynamic data by users in a database and give a custom experience.  

But they do come with their own sets of problems and need monitoring and maintenance.  Storing data on users can lead to catastrophes, like the recent Facebook situation. Servers can also slow down and affect site performance without proper handling.

There are alternatives to this though.

In some situations, you may not even need paid hosting or a private server. All sorts of sites are migrating towards Static Site Generators.  These style of sites offer a pretty solid middle ground between static and dynamic sites.

This may seem limiting.  But, there are many services available to to perform these functions.  There are ways to connect server functions and databases to static sites.  While not dynamic in the correct context, it is more than enough for most peoples needs.   

Assets include the bulk of what will make up your website.  Ranging from logos and images to web copy and domains.  Good web design usually stems from having your content and working the web page around them. It is crucial to start collecting these assets early to keep your project on track and inline with goals.

Your domain name is another more ambiguous piece of a website for people. When choosing a domain name, you will want to pick something easy to remember, relevant to your brand and one that is scalable. There are many services available to register domains with, and, personally, I recommend [<ins>Namecheap.</ins>](https://www.namecheap.com/)  They even have a search function that allows you to check what is available.

While some of these things may be a bit beyond your comfort level, having an idea of what you want when you initially meet with a designer or developer can help them better understand your needs. 

## Still want that website?

The process of getting everything together for a website can be daunting.  It is a big decision, and one that I do not think you should try to figure all out on your own. Partner with your designer or your developer, identify your goals, research other sites similar to what you are looking for, and brainstorm.  The point is not to  go in with a full blown plan in your head, but rather to have a good head start. If, during the process, you nail exactly what you want, that is not bad either, but I still suggest partnering with your developer to work with them on the implementation.

To help ease the process, create a checklist of what you need to plan out and create a file, either on your computer or in the cloud, that you can start collecting assets in, screen shot inspiring sites or cool features, store font ideas and more in.  This will also give you another good head start when you need to hand these off to your designer or developer.

Have fun with your website and make it reflect you and your brand and try not to be weighed down by all the overhead that comes from a website. If you approach it tactfully, informed, and early, the process is nowhere near as intimidating as it could be.
