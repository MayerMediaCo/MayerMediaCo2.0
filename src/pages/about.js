                I am a creative entrepreneur aiming to help others succeed.</p>
              <p>From a young age, I had always put all my passion and effort into whatever
                creative endeavor I was doing at that moment, whether it was music, design,
                photography, or writing. I believe in breaking down the barriers in your area of
                expertise as a way of improving your thinking towards the subject. Having years
                of experience in creative mediums, the drive for absolute perfection and a love
                for technology drove me towards web design and development as a way to satisfy
                all the different aspects of my passions.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="column">
              <p>I decided to take the leap into the freelance journey as a way to express my
                creativity, challange myself and my capabilities, and to educate brands who are
                like minded.</p>
              <p>
                I spent much on my high school career dedicated to small side hustles that
                involved the local music scene. I would do everything from Social Media
                Management to Myspace Layouts to even booking and promoting and audio
                engineering. I apply the same desires I had to see the local music scene thrive
                that I do today in working with my clients to take their brands to the next
                level.

              <p>Coming from a varied background that includes sales, marketing, management,
                and finance, I differ from a lot of other creative entrepreneurs.
              </p>
              <p>How does that all tie together? I understand the structure of businesses,
                both large and small. I understand the importance of budgeting, how to
                collaborate and achieve set goals. I understand the relationship between company
                and consumer and what it takes to bridge the gap.
              </p>
              <p>How does this apply to you?</p>
              <p>I apply this extensive history to every project I undertake. Having
                experience in multiple parts of the chain, I utilize these many different
                perspectives to ensure the best possible outcome.</p>
              <p>I work with my clients to fully understand the needs of their business and
                help bridge gaps over the disconnect that happens in between. I make business
                decisions solely for the belief of wanting others to grow and exceed in their
                business or creative endeavors.</p>
              <p>
                I work for the small business opportunists looking to impact the world with
                their products and services and the creative individuals looking to stand out
                and make their mark in their craft.
